I created this game when I was in grade 8, in 2020 as a graded project for my Computers Elective Programme course

# 5_in_1_game
This is a game consists of 5 minigames: 
  1. Tic Tac Toe 
  2. Hangman
  3. Mastermind
  4. Sudoku
  5. Tiles

Do read the README.txt file to understand how to run the program, and have fun playing the games 😁😁
